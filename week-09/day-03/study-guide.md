# Week 9 Day 3

## Event Handling

Learning Objectives:

- Be very familiar with these common event listeners: `click`, `submit`,
  `change`, and `DOMContentLoaded`
- Research to discover and utilize a new event listener to accomplish a given
  task
- Add and/or remove an event listener from one or more HTML elements
- Manipulate the DOM as a response to an event
- Diagram how an event propagates
- Predict and prevent the default behavior of an event
- Add, remove, and read data on an HTML element

### What are Events?

- **Event** - an action that happens on an HTML DOM element
  - common events that you need to know well for the assessment:
    - `click` - when the mouse presses and releases on an _HTML element_
      - [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event)
      - ex: a `click` event on a `button` element
    - `submit` - when an _HTML `form` element_ is submitted
      - [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event)
      - ex: the `submit` event on a `form` element
    - `change` - when the value of an _HTML `input`/`select`/`textarea` element_
      is committed as a change
      - [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event)
      - ex: the user selects a different option on a `select` element
      - to check the `value` of an HTML `input`/`select`/`textarea` element in
        JavaScript, use the `value` property on the HTML element:
        - ex: if you type "Hello World!" into an input of type "text",
          `input.value` would be "Hello World!"
    - `input` - whenever an _HTML `input`/`select`/`textarea` element_'s value
      changes
      - [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event)
      - ex: the user types in a value in an `input` element
    - `DOMContentLoaded` - when the HTML DOM is fully loaded without waiting
      for stylesheets, images, and other assets to finish loading
      - [MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event)
      - `DOMContentLoaded` event is an action that can only be done on the
        `window` object (BOM) or the `document` object (DOM)
      - **NOTE**: this is different from the `window.onload` function because
        the `window.onload` gets called when the HTML DOM AND all assets are
        finished loading. It's more common to use the `DOMContentLoaded` event
        when running JS files in the frontend that read/manipulate HTML DOM
        elements.
  - there are a ton other events that you don't need to know how to use exactly,
    but you should be able to use the MDN documentation for any event type and
    figure out how to use it
    - all other event types: [MDN Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#event_listing)
  - **Event Delegation** - 
  - **Event Propagation** - 
  - **Default Event Behavior** - 
  - So how do you programmatically execute code whenever an event on an HTML
    element happens or gets triggered? By subscribing to the particular event
    on a specific HTML element using an event listener
- **Event Listener** - allows you to execute code whenever a particular event
  on a specific HTML element happens or gets triggered
  - like a subscription to an event
  - `element.addEventListener(eventType, callbackFunction)` - execute the
    `callbackFunction` when an event of the type of `eventType` happens to the
    specific HTML element, `element`, that you call the `.addEventListener()`
    method on
    - `callbackFunction(event)` will be invoked or called with an `event` object
      whenever the event gets triggered
      - `event` object - contains information about the elements that were
        involved in the event and some properties and methods that you can use
        to influence what happens next
      - useful properties on the `event` object:
        - `event.target` - the HTML element that triggered the event listener
        - `event.currentTarget` - the HTML element that you attached the event
          listener to
        - `event.defaultPrevented` - a boolean representing if the default
          behavior of the event has been prevented or not
      - useful methods on the `event` object:
        - `event.preventDefault()` - prevents the default behavior of the event
          to happen
        - `event.stopPropagation()` - prevents the event from bubbling or
          triggering event listeners on HTML elements higher than the HTML
          element that you attached the event listener to in the HTML DOM tree
  - `element.removeEventListener(eventType, callbackFunction)` - remove the
    event listener set by a previous `.addEventListener()` call for the event
    type of `eventType` on a specific HTML element, `element`, and a reference
    to the original function that you called `.addEventListener()` with

Examples of using event listeners:

To print "Hello World!" to the console when the HTML DOM is fully loaded, you
would add an event listener to the `window` for the `eventType` of
`DOMContentLoaded` and in the `callbackFunction`, print "Hello World!":

```js
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => console.log("Hello World!"));
```

To print the value of a form `<input type="text">` when a user types a character
in the input, you would add an event listener to the `<input>` element for the
`eventType` of `input` and in the `callbackFunction`, print the value of the
`<input>` using the information about the `<input>` element in the `event`
object:

```js
const textInput = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]')
textInput.addEventListener('input', (event) => {
  console.log(event.currentTarget.value));
});
```

### Read/Update `data-` attributes

`data-` attributes are really useful for storing data that doesn't need to be
displayed on HTML elements.

Given the following HTML:

```html
<div data-banana="yellow"></div>
```

You can read and update `data-` attributes on an HTML element:

```js
const div = document.querySelector('div');
div.dataset.banana; // "yellow"
div.dataset.coolInfo = "Hello World!";
```

The above code will change the HTML to be:

```html
<div data-banana="yellow" data-cool-info="Hello World!"></div>
```
