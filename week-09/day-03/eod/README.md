# EOD

Keep practicing element selection and manipulation that you learned in the last
two days! These topics will be tested on a lot in the coding portion of the
assessment.

Studying from the learning objectives from this week are also a really good
way of studying for the assessment.

An example of `event.stopPropagation()` is in this __eod__ folder. You can use
it to play around with how `stopPropagation` works!
