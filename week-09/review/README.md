# Week 9 Review

**Good Luck on Tuesday everyone!!!**

## Suggested Study Plan

- Take the practice assessment at least 5 times over
  - Finish the practice assessment in under half the allotted time (around 1
    hour or less)
- Do the Catstagram project
  - Repeat this as many times as it takes to get comfortable doing it without
    referencing the solution
- Go through study guides from Monday through Thursday
  - identify which concepts you still need work in

## Suggested Practices

**DO THIS LAST AFTER YOU FINISH THE SUGGESTED STUDY PLAN.**

For the following concepts, identify which ones you feel uncomfortable with.
If a practice is suggested, then do the practice as many times as it takes to
get comfortable doing it without referencing the solution. If an example
project is suggested, then play around with the code in the example project
until you feel comfortable with the concept. If a quiz is suggested, take the
quiz until you can get 100% of the questions right. (You should try to spread
out the time that you retake the quiz. For example, retaking the quiz after one
hour of taking it will give you a better sense of if you retained the knowledge
from taking it the first time.)

Prioritize the concepts you need most help in. It's not recommended to do all
the of the following practices.
