# Importing Scripts into HTML Practice

To start, clone the [repository][repo].

You have been given some simple scripts that will run on an HTML page.
However, none of them have been properly imported into the HTML. Your job
will be to import them properly using the `<script>` tag.

The scripts will be placed in varying folder structures. Keep in mind the
structure when you are importing.

The scripts should be in the order:

- level1.js
- level2.js
- level3.js
- level4.js

It is up to you whether you want to place them in the head, body, or both.

Do NOT touch `app.js`. Instead, when you have finished importing, run
`node app.js` from the base directory. Open `localhost:5000` in your browser
and open the console to make sure the scripts were imported properly. You
should see a thumbs up created by ASCII characters.
