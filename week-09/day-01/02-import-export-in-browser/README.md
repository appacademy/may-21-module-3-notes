# Importing and Exporting using ES6 Practice

You've been provided code for a page that displays Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head.
There are three buttons: one that makes them say hello, one for goodbye, and
one to switch to the other.

The programmer has written all the code for you, but forgot to `import` and
`export` the files. Your job will be to look through the `assets` folder,
find files that are dependencies or have dependencies, and connect them with
the proper statements.

To start, clone the [repository][repo].

Some requirements and points to keep in mind:

- Use `export default` at least once
- Do NOT touch `app.js`
- Do NOT use CommonJS syntax for this exercise

When you have connected everything, run `node app.js` in your terminal and open
the application at `localhost:5000`. Test the buttons to make sure they work
as described.

Keep in mind that Mr. Potato Head's quotes are different from Mrs. Potato
Head's!
