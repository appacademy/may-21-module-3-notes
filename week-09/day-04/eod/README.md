# EOD

Keep practicing element selection and manipulation that you learned in the last
three days! These topics will be tested on a lot in the coding portion of the
assessment. Today's material will be tested on more so in the multiple choice,
but it will show up a little in the coding portion.

Studying from the learning objectives from this week are also a really good
way of studying for the assessment.

An example of `event.stopPropagation()` is in day-03's  __eod__ folder.
