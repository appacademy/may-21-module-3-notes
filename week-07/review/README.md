# Week 7 Review

## Suggested Study Plan for the Weekend

- Do some short practices
  - Prioritize the short practices that you had trouble with this past week
  - Start over from scratch and follow instructions to do the practice again,
    don't just skim over your past code or the solutions
  - Compare the solutions with your code
- Take the practice assessment at least 5 times over
  - Finish the practice assessment in under half the allotted time (around 1
    hour)
