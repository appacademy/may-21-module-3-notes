# Week 7 Day 5

**None of the topics for this day will be tested on the assessment!!**

## Deployment

Learning Objectives:

- Deploy a webpage with static assets onto Netlify

### What does deploying a web application mean?

- **deployment** is the act of releasing or making available a software product
  - the final step in a software development cycle
- For websites, it means to put your website on the internet
  - This includes a lot of complicated processes that using hosting services can
    easily solve for you
- **hosting service** - a service that simplifies setting up your website or
  application on the internet
  - features that are often included in the service are:
    - domain registration
    - file hosting
    - email hosting
    - cloud storage
    - security (ex: against DoS attacks)
    - **continuous integration/deployment** - or CI/CD, allow you to
      automatically re-deploy, or update, your site whenever you add/update
      code on your web application
  - examples of hosting services:
    - Netlify
    - Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud
    - Google Cloud
    - Microsoft Azure
    - Digital Ocean
    - ...and many more!

### Deploy a static project onto Netlify

- Netlify is a popular and simple to use hosting service, especially for
  applications with no backend server (pure frontend, like the projects you
  created this week)
- To use it all you need to do is create an account, link your GitHub account,
  click a button, select a repo that contains a web application, and boom! Your
  web app is on the internet!

Follow the instructions in the practice to deploy any static project onto
Netlify.
