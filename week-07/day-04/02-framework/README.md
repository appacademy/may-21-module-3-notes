# CSS Framework Project

CSS frameworks are pre-built CSS libraries that include the styling of various
UI elements. Some great frameworks are [Bootstrap][bootstrap],
[MaterialUI][materialui], [PureCSS][purecss], and [Tailwind][tailwind]. These
frameworks are useful because they look professionally done and save time when
developing projects.

## The Objective

Today, you will be making your own custom CSS framework. Your main objective is
to style the HTML with your own CSS preferences to make it look like a genuine
web page. This allows you to get experience practicing your styling to make a
site look well planned and designed. As well as, saves you time in the future
because this code can be reused in future projects. You are encouraged to try
to make a more opinionated framework like Material UI first.
Then when you are more comfortable move on to more un-opinionated frameworks
like Tailwind with media queries. Let your creativity lead you to design
appealing components and help give you a stronger sense of web development.

## Phase 0

Download the repo [here].

## Phase 1

Navigate to the framework HTML file. Create a CSS file and link it to your
framework HTML. Then open up the page in your browser.

## Phase 2

Identify all the separate components and begin styling them to your preference.
Feel free to experiment with it all the different possibilities CSS has to offer.
If you feel stuck, go search a website that you are fond of and try to get
inspiration from them.

## Phase 3

Once you are done, save the file and make sure you keep it in your library
because it will come in handy in the future.

## Bonus

Try to add Media Queries to your project.
