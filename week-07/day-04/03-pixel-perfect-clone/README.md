# Pixel Perfect Project

As a developer, there will be times when someone will ask you to create a new
web page based on a designer-created render showing _exactly_ what the
page _must_ look like.  For interviews, you may be asked to do this or
replicate an exact copy of an existing web page. You should have the tools and
knowledge to be able to create a web page that looks aesthetically pleasing with
multiple CSS effect features on it.  This is your chance to show off your skill
and precision.

In this project, you will use HTML and CSS attributes to make a pixel-perfect
copy of a homepage of your choosing. You can either pick a homepage of a website
you wish to copy or from a list we have provided. Use what you've learned about
wireframes, HTML, and CSS to apply styles to various elements.

## Project overview

The objective of this project is to make a copy of a homepage of your choosing.
Make sure you identify all of the HTML and CSS elements on the page. For
example, if there is a hover effect over a button or an image carousel feature
on the page. Try to replicate that down to the pixel.

Choose from this list:

- [Medium][medium]
- [Yelp][yelp]
- [Genius][genius]
- [Flickr][flickr]
- [Hipcamp][hipcamp]
- [Wufoo][wufoo]

Your goal is to try to make as close to a pixel-perfect copy as possible with
all of the CSS features that are presented on their homepage.

## When you're done

Go back through and make additional changes as you see fit -- make it your own!
Have fun with it.
