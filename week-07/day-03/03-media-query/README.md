# Practice: CSS Media Queries

In this practice, you will use media queries to improve a web page. The content
and common styles have already been done for you, so you only need to add
__media queries__ to the CSS.

Begin by downloading the practice [starter]. Then drag the __index.html__ file
into your browser (e.g. Chrome) to load the webpage, or use the
**File Explorer** to open the __index.html__ in your browser.

## Phase 1: Layout adjustments

Here are the designer's mockups for various screen sizes. What's already
implemented covers the narrow and extremely narrow cases.

Please implement the "moderate", "wide" and "extremely wide" cases. The narrow
option is for 820 pixels or less; and wide, for 1220 pixels or greater.

> Note: The following images are scaled down to fit into the instructions.
> You can right click and select "Open Image in New Tab" to see them full-size.

### Extremely Narrow

Only the header is included because the rest of the page is the same as narrow.

### Extremely Wide

     style="border: solid grey 4px"
/>

## Phase 2: Printing

The customer noticed that the printout is using a lot of color. To solve this,
the site owner says that the only important information to include in the
printout is the story itself, and it's okay to always print it without the
purple background color.

Please hide everything except the story and make the background white when the
page is printed.

     alt="Print Preview"
/>

## Bonus Phase

The designer saw the new printout and asked if it would be possible to include
the image. Here's a mockup of their vision.

Can you make the print out look like this?

### Portrait

### Landscape
