# Practice: Formulating Responses

Create a server that sends the following HTML text:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello there!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure to set the appropriate response status code, headers, and body.

Test your server by using Postman. Make a request to your server and examine the
response sent back by your server to make sure the status code, headers, and
body that you set are all accounted for.
