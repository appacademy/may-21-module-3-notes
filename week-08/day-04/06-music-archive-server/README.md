# Music Archive Server

Clone the project from the [starter].

In this project, you will implement the code for the server that you documented
in the previous project.

Take a look at the server code in `server.js`. `GET /artists` is already
implemented for you. The seed data for artists, albums, and songs are read from
the JSON files in the `seeds` folder.

Implement the code for the rest of the endpoints that you documented in the
API docs project.

Make sure your server request-response for every endpoint matches the example
that you used to help you create the documentation.
