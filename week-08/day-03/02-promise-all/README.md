# Practice: Promise.all

In this practice, you will refactor the code from Part 1 of the Creating and
Handling Promises Practice.

## Multi-task Activities Workout

In this part, you will force the person working out to do a really intense
workout that involves multi-tasking. You want the person to start to stretch,
run on the treadmill, and lift weights all at the same time.

In Part 1 of the Creating and Handling Promises Practice, the workout had each
of the activities done one after the other. Refactor the code in the `workout`
function so that the activities start at the same time. When all of them are
finished, print `"done working out"`.

Test your code by running the file in node (`node part-1.js`). You should see
the following in your terminal printed out in this exact order:

```plaintext
done running on treadmill
done stretching
done lifting weights
done working out
```
