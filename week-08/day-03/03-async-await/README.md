# Practice: Async/Await

In this practice, you will work on handling `Promise`s with `async`/`await`.

## Part 1: Async Workout

For this part, refactor your code from `part-1.js` in the practice for
creating and handling promises.

Use `async` & `await` to refactor the `workout` function. The function runs the
given functions in a way that ensures you begin running on the treadmill after
you're finished stretching, you begin lifting weights after you've finished
running on the treadmill. Print `"done working out"` after you've finished
lifting weights.

### Test your code

Run the file (`node part-1.js`) and check your output against the expected
output provided at the bottom of the file.

## Part 2: Async Effective Workout

For this part, refactor your code from `part-2.js` in the practice for
creating and handling promises.

Use `async` & `await` to refactor the `workout` function.

### Test again

Comment in each invocation of the workout function listed at the bottom
and run the file (`node part-2.js`) to see if you get the expected output.
