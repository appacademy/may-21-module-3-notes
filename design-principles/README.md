# Discussion Design Principles

In this discussion, go to a website and look around the site. Discuss with your
partner what you like, dislike and what you would change. Make notes of what
design features or flaws that notice.

Feel free to go to a website you already enjoy or take a look at:

- Instagram: https://instagram.com/
- CraigsList: https://craigslist.org/
  - plain, but simple design
- GitHub: https://github.com/
  - Great for browsing repos
  - homepage is bad, but who visits the homepage for GitHub anyway?
- Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/
  - plain, but easy to browse
- PaulGraham: http://paulgraham.com/
  - primitive, but let's you know you're there for the writing
  - page navigation and routes are excellent
- Supreme: https://www.supremenewyork.com/
  - worldwide design company, but breaks a lot of standard design conventions,
    why?
  - The front page has tiny, unreadable navigation, but a massively prominent
    logo
  - important to learn the rules before you break them

Common Takeaways (Are the design concepts good, bad, or could be improved?):

- Take away everything that does not matter to emphasize what does matter.
  - Easy to find the category that you want to browse by in CraigsList and
    Reddit
  - For GitHub it's navigating code repos
  - For Paul Graham, it's timeless essays
  - For Supreme, it's the logo above everything else
- Some sites cater to a fairly narrow group of users
  - developers for GitHub
  - tech savvy youths for Supreme
- A widely used site like Instagram, Facebook or even Twitter must be usable by
  anyone and also be aesthetically pleasing.
  - more important that they be "slick" with UI that does not break any
    conventions
